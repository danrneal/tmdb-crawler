# TMDB Crawler

A script that uses the TMDB API to get all number one box office hits and find any that are currently steaming that I haven't watched yet.

## Set-up

Set-up a virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

You should see (env) before your command prompt now. (You can type `deactivate` to exit the virtual environment any time.)

Install the requirements:

```bash
pip install -U pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Make sure you are in the virtual environment (you should see (env) before your command prompt). If not `source /env/bin/activate` to enter it.

```bash
Usage: crawler.py
```
